# Nodebots v2 — Frontend Masters

This workshop uses parts from the [Arduino Starter Kit](https://amzn.to/3OA3Td9).

## Prerequisites

- Clone this repository.
- Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).

## Resources

You can find the [wiring diagrams](./public/diagrams/) from this workshop [here](./public/diagrams/)

## Further Exploration

Because the Johnny-Five starter kit—which is what we used in the last iteration of this course—is now out of production. We're doing some slightly different projects than last time. That said, once you get your sea legs, you could also easily adapt some of those projects for use with your Arduino as well. You can see the projects and code from last time [here](https://github.com/stevekinney/nodebots-workshop).

### Sensors

Playing with sensors is the best. Here are some cool—an inexpensive sensors that you can use with your Arduino—or, any other board for that matter.

- [Magnetic Door Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13247)
- [Proximity Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15177)

### Boards that Run Node.js

An Arduino cannot run Node.js without a host computer, but there are boards that can!
