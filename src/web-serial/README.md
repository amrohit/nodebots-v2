# Web Serial API

**Important Note**: You will need to flash your Arduino with a different sketch. If you want to go back to Johnny-Five, then you'll need to flash it with Standard Firmata again.

### Web Serial API

The Web Serial API is an interface that provides web applications with the ability to connect to serial devices, such as USB-to-serial adapters, Bluetooth-to-serial devices, and more. It is part of the web platform's efforts to give web apps more access to hardware-level features. The API provides methods to read from and write to serial devices, and it works in a similar fashion as other web APIs, utilizing promises for asynchronous operations.
