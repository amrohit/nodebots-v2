# Wattage versus Voltage

Watts and volts are units that measure different aspects of electricity:

1. **Volts (V)**: This is a measure of voltage, which you can think of as the electric force that pushes electric current around a circuit. It's a bit like the water pressure in a pipe. In technical terms, voltage is the difference in electric potential energy between two points in a circuit.

2. **Watts (W)**: This is a measure of power, or how much energy is used (or produced) over a certain amount of time. In the context of electricity, one watt is equal to one ampere of current flowing at one volt.

The relationship between watts, volts, and amps (the unit of electric current) is defined by another important law in electronics called the Power Law, which states:

Power (Watts) = Voltage (Volts) x Current (Amperes)

So, if you know the voltage and the current, you can multiply them together to get the power in watts.

In a practical sense, when you're using an electrical device, the voltage (V) typically refers to the level of force pushing the electricity into the device (like the 120 or 240 volts from your wall outlet), and the power (in watts) refers to the amount of electrical energy the device uses per unit of time. For example, a 60-watt light bulb uses 60 watts of power to produce light.
