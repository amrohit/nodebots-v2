# Resistance

Resistance is a measure of the degree to which an object opposes the flow of electric current. You can think of it like the friction that slows down water flowing through a pipe.

The unit of measurement for resistance is the ohm (symbol: Î©), named after the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm.

In an electrical or electronic circuit, resistance can control how much current flows in the circuit. Components called resistors are used to introduce resistance into a circuit. They can be used for various purposes, like reducing the current that flows to a sensitive component, dividing voltage, or creating heat.

Different materials have different resistivities, meaning they resist the flow of electric current to different degrees. For example, metals like copper and silver have low resistivities and make good conductors, while rubber and glass have high resistivities and are good insulators.

The relationship between resistance, voltage, and current in a circuit is described by Ohm's Law: Voltage = Current x Resistance (or V = I x R). So if you know the voltage across an object and the current flowing through it, you can calculate its resistance.
