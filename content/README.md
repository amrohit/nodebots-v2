# Enough Electronics to Be Dangerous

Let's imagine electricity like water flowing through a garden hose.

1. **[Voltage](voltage.md)**: Think of voltage like the water pressure in the hose. The more pressure, the more power there is to make the water flow. If you increase the pressure, more water can flow out. If you decrease it, less water comes out. So, voltage is like the push that gets the electricity flowing.

2. **[Current](current.md)**: Current would be like the amount of water that flows through the hose. If a lot of water is flowing through the hose, we can say there's a large current. If only a little water is trickling out, then there's a small current.

3. **[Resistance](resistance.md)**: Imagine you squeeze the hose. This makes it harder for water to flow through, right? That's resistance. It's anything that tries to slow down or resist the electricity from flowing.

So, when you turn on a garden hose (increase voltage), a lot of water (current) comes out, unless you squeeze or kink the hose (increase resistance) which reduces the flow of water (reduces current).
